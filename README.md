# Mojo Marathons ðŸ”¥

A monthly competition for the best Mojicians to showcase their skills and push Mojo to its limits, with prizes and recognition for winners!

Mojo Marathons are Modular recognized and sponsored, currently hosted by @Benny-Nottonson. Any suggestions for contests, rule changes, or questions can be directed to @benny.n on discord. 

These marathons are intended to push the community to build together, and will ideally be focused on ML and AI topics. 

## Rules & Regulations

All final verdicts will be decided by the community, if there is a vote needed to arbitrate a  decision, it will be called through the discussions. 

The current rules are as follows

- All code must be written purely in Mojo
- All dependencies must be from only the stdlib (i.e. no dependencies)
- Using MLIR / External Calls will be judged case by case
- Submissions will be accepted as novel only if they represent tangible differences

These rules are intended to push programmers to rely only on core language features, and present real and practical changes to top solutions.
